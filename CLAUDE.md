# kpi-console

A SvelteKit KPI console over the dbt-semantic-mcp warehouse: catalog, query, chart, and lineage — every number through the governed MCP tools

**Tier**: T1  **Language**: typescript  **Test discipline**: pragmatic

This file is **read by every Claude Code session** that opens this repo.
Keep it short, scannable, and load-bearing. Long-form prose belongs in
`docs/`. Personal scratch notes (TODOs, ad-hoc commands, half-formed
ideas) belong in `CLAUDE.local.md` (gitignored).

## What this is

A SvelteKit console whose server routes are an MCP client of dbt-semantic-mcp
(stdio). It does NOT touch DuckDB, define metrics, or compose SQL — all reads
go through the governed MCP tools (ADR 0001). Set DBT_SEMANTIC_MCP_DIR to a
backend checkout for dev and tests.

## Build / test / lint

All verbs go through `just`. Never run the underlying tool directly in
docs — that creates two sources of truth.

```sh
just            # list all recipes
just fmt        # auto-format
just lint       # lint (warnings → errors)
just test       # run tests per discipline (pragmatic)
just build      # build release artifact
just check      # fmt + lint + test (the merge gate)
```

Tier-2 release path:

```sh
just release patch    # tag + push (CI does the build/sign/SBOM/SLSA)
just release minor
just release major
```

## Architecture

Three to five bullets. Where the code lives, what each top-level dir
does, key invariants a newcomer can't infer from a `tree` listing.
Update when the layout changes.

- `src/lib/server/mcp.ts` — the only place that talks to the backend; keep it that way.
- `src/lib/server/parse.ts` + `src/lib/chart.ts` — pure, unit-tested transforms.
- `src/routes/api/*` — thin JSON wrappers over mcp.ts; `src/routes/+page.svelte` — the UI.
- `tests/` — vitest, no backend needed; biome is scoped away from .svelte files
  (svelte-check owns those).
- `.github/workflows/` — CI; SHA-pinned actions; svelte-check not tsc.

## Conventions

- **Conventional Commits**, signed (`git commit -sS`).
- **Lockfile committed**.
- **Pre-commit installed** — `pre-commit install` once after clone.
- **GitHub Actions pinned by SHA** — Renovate / Dependabot keeps fresh.
- **Container base images pinned by digest** if any.
- **Structured logging** — no `print()` / `console.log` in committed code.
